## Date picker

Date pickers use a dialog window or an inline popover to select a single date.
The selected day is indicated by a filled circle. The current day is indicated by a different
color and type weight.

#### Basic usage

<Example
  title="Basic usage"
  sourceFile="api/datepicker/BasicDatePicker.example.jsx"
/>

#### Keyboard Input

It is recommended to use keyboard input with mask for better desktop experience. More information about [mask](https://github.com/insin/inputmask-core#pattern)

<Example sourceFile="api/datepicker/KeyboardDatePicker.example.jsx" />

#### Different views

It is also allowed to combine `year`, `month` and `date` selection views.
Thus you can easily create
- Year picker
- Month picker
- Month + year picker

<Example sourceFile="api/datepicker/ViewsDatePicker.example.jsx" />

#### Inline mode

<Example sourceFile="api/datepicker/InlineDatePicker.example.jsx" />

#### Customization

It is allowed to hardly customize displaying of dates. Thus you can add badges or fully change displaying of day.
