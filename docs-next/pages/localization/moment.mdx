## Localization with moment

Moment localization relying on the global moment object used.

It is also possible to pass configured global moment with selected locale, default timezone, etc.
Also pass selected locale as string to the provider to make pickers rerenders automatically on
locale change.

  title="Example"
  sourceFile="localization/Moment.example.jsx"
  description="Note: Any picker in component tree will be rerendered automatically on locale change"
/>
